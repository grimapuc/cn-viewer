# cn-viewer
Visualization for browsing the ConceptNet Graph

## Current status

The `better.html` version use the ConceptNet 5.5 API available from `api.conceptnet.io`. 

Just open `better.html` in browser, ~~or go to [hercules.ing.puc.cl/~cruz/cn-viewer/better.html]~~

## Requirements for running locally

If you want to not depend on the public ConceptNet API, you need to install a local version of the ConceptNet 5.5 API.

For running ConceptNet API 5.5, follow the "Docker" instructions on 

https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet5/wiki/Running-your-own-copy

then you need to modify the variable `url_api` on `better.html`
